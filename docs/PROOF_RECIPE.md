# Resilience Proof Recipe & Log-Completeness Gate

Bead: `coding_agent_session_search-cass-fleet-resilience-20260608-uojcg.12.6`.

The single named proof suite that implementers run **identically locally and
in CI** for the resilience rollout, plus the log-completeness gate that makes
the integrated resilience gate (`.11.5`) unable to pass by doing nothing.

Pairs with:
- **`.12.1`** — [`RESILIENCE_TEST_MATRIX.md`](RESILIENCE_TEST_MATRIX.md): which proof each family owes.
- **`.12.3`** — `src/search/proof_log.rs`: the proof-log record + retention.
- **`.12.4`** — `UNIT_TEST_HARNESS_REQUIREMENTS.md`: unit cases per family.
- **`.12.5`** — `src/search/e2e_scenarios.rs`: the CI/live scenarios.
- **`.12.2`** — `src/e2e_runner.rs`: the bounded runner.

All commands follow `AGENTS.md`: remote compilation via `rch`, an isolated
`CARGO_TARGET_DIR`, and `-D warnings` on clippy.

## 0. Conventions

- **Remote build/test:** prefix cargo with
  `rch exec -- env CARGO_TARGET_DIR=<isolated-dir> ...`. Use a per-agent dir
  (e.g. `/tmp/cass-check-target`) so concurrent agents don't collide.
- **Success signal:** grep the output for `Finished` and the
  `test result: ok.` line — do **not** trust a piped exit code (a `| tail`
  pipeline masks cargo's status).
- **Format:** edition 2024 (`rustfmt --edition 2024 <file>` /
  `cargo fmt --check`).

## 1. Compile / lint / format gate (after substantive code changes)

```sh
# Full compile of every target (lib, tests, benches):
rch exec -- env CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/tmp/cass-check-target cargo check --all-targets
# Lint, warnings-as-errors, crate-wide:
rch exec -- env CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/tmp/cass-check-target cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
# Format check:
cargo fmt --check
# Bug scan on changed files (exit 0 required; #[cfg(test)] helper panics and
# intentional fake-secret fixtures are acceptable, triaged, criticals):
ubs <changed-files> --ci
```

## 2. Targeted unit/integration tests by feature family

Run the family you touched (fast; isolated target dir optional). The
resilience contract cores live under `src/search/` and `src/indexer/`:

```sh
# Readiness & archive-risk (.1.x):           cargo test --lib search::readiness
# Readiness fixtures (.1.5):                  cargo test --lib search::readiness_fixtures
# Liveness: progress/stall (.4.1):           cargo test --lib search::progress_contract
# Liveness: salvage ledger (.4.2):           cargo test --lib search::salvage_ledger
# Liveness: watch recovery (.4.3):           cargo test --lib search::watch_recovery
# Liveness: watch-exit envelope (.4.4):      cargo test --lib search::watch_exit_envelope
# Liveness fixtures (.4.5):                   cargo test --lib search::liveness_fixtures
# Semantic readiness (.5.1):                  cargo test --lib search::semantic_readiness
# Semantic progress sink (.5.2):              cargo test --lib indexer::semantic_progress
# Semantic publish safety (.5.3):             cargo test --lib search::semantic_publish_safety
# Workspace zero-result (.7.1):               cargo test --lib search::zero_result_diagnosis
# Source provenance (.7.2):                   cargo test --lib search::source_provenance
# Drill-down (.7.3):                          cargo test --lib search::drill_down
# Workspace/source fixtures (.7.4):           cargo test --lib search::workspace_source_fixtures
# Quarantine compat (.3.4):                   cargo test --lib indexer::quarantine
# Incident categories (.10.1):                cargo test --lib search::incident_categories
# Incident redaction (.10.5):                 cargo test --lib search::incident_redaction
# Storage integrity (.14.1):                  cargo test --lib search::storage_integrity
# Proof-log schema (.12.3):                   cargo test --lib search::proof_log
# Regression corpus (.11.2):                  cargo test --lib search::regression_corpus
# Recovery journeys (.13.1):                  cargo test --lib search::recovery_journeys
# E2E scenarios (.12.5):                      cargo test --lib search::e2e_scenarios
```

Each prefixed with `rch exec -- env CARGO_TARGET_DIR=<dir>`. A green run is
`test result: ok. N passed; 0 failed`.

## 3. Golden update flow

Golden artifacts (pinned JSON/JSONL wire forms) change **only** through a
reviewed run:

```sh
UPDATE_GOLDENS=1 rch exec -- env CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/tmp/cass-check-target cargo test <golden-target>
```

A `UPDATE_GOLDENS=1` diff must be reviewed as an intentional contract change
(it is a wire-format break otherwise). The default (unset) run asserts
goldens unchanged.

## 4. Shared E2E runner (quick / full)

The `.12.2` runner executes the `.12.5` scenarios against the real `cass`
binary into an artifact directory under a bounded timeout, emitting one
`.12.3` `ProofLogRecord` per command:

```sh
# quick: the CI scenario set (no live host) — the default gate.
cass-e2e-runner --mode quick --artifacts <dir> --timeout-ms <budget>
# full: quick + opt-in live-host scenarios (operator only; never CI-required).
cass-e2e-runner --mode full --live-hosts <hosts> --artifacts <dir>
```

`--mode quick` runs exactly `e2e_scenarios::ci_scenarios()` (every named
fleet/archive state, deterministically, no live host). Live scenarios
(`requires_live_host=true`) run only under `--mode full`.

## 5. Log-completeness gate (the integrated gate cannot pass by doing nothing)

After a runner pass, the gate asserts the artifact directory's
`ProofLogRecord`s are **complete**, not merely "no failures observed":

1. **Coverage:** the set of `scenario_id`s with a record equals
   `e2e_scenarios::ci_scenarios()` (quick) — a missing scenario is a gate
   failure, not a silent skip.
2. **No empty pass:** the record count is ≥ the expected scenario×command
   count; zero records fails the gate (cannot pass by doing nothing).
3. **Outcome integrity:** every record's `outcome` is `passed`. Any
   `timed_out_partial`, `stale_artifact_reused`, `invalid_json`,
   `did_not_run`, or `failed` fails the gate — these are distinguished by the
   `.12.3` schema precisely so a timeout/stale/skip can never read as a pass.
4. **Freshness:** records are from this run (`finished_at_ms` within the run
   window), not a reused stale artifact.
5. **Redaction:** `RetentionPolicy::is_redaction_safe` holds for every
   retained record (no secret-bearing `sanitized_env` keys).

A closure report cites the artifact directory + the per-scenario
`ProofLogRecord` outcomes; "tests pass" prose without cited artifacts does
not satisfy the closure checklist in `RESILIENCE_TEST_MATRIX.md`.

## 6. The named suite (one command surface)

Implementers and CI invoke the same logical suite:

1. §1 compile/lint/format gate.
2. §2 targeted family tests for changed families (or all, in CI).
3. §4 `--mode quick` E2E runner into an artifact dir.
4. §5 log-completeness gate over the artifacts.

Local and CI differ only in scope (`--mode quick` vs a nightly `--mode full`)
and target-dir isolation — never in the assertions. This is the recipe a
closure must cite by exact command + artifact path.

## 7. Real-binary robot dispatch smoke gate (`.2.4`)

Bead `…uojcg.2.4`. Where §4's runner exercises fleet/archive **state**
scenarios, this gate exercises **dispatch correctness** of the critical robot
surfaces — the gap that let **pass-12** (`doctor --json` returning the agent
handbook) slip past every golden/unit check, because those checked the right
*emitter* while real dispatch pointed at the wrong one.

```sh
# Routine (sub-second per surface against an isolated empty data dir):
rch exec -- env CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/tmp/cass-check-target \
  cargo test --test e2e_robot_smoke_gate
# CI proof artifacts (.12.3 structured log + manifest via PhaseTracker):
E2E_LOG=1 rch exec -- env CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/tmp/cass-check-target \
  cargo test --test e2e_robot_smoke_gate
```

`tests/e2e_robot_smoke_gate.rs` runs the real `cass` binary across
`api-version`, `capabilities`, `introspect`, `diag`, `health`, `status`,
`doctor`, `triage`, `search`, `pack`, `stats`, and `view`, asserting per
surface: **success payloads are pure JSON on stdout** (parse consumes the
whole trimmed stdout), **surface-identity keys** (e.g. doctor →
`checks`+`doctor_command`; the dispatch proof), and — for the error surfaces —
**the `{error:{...}}` envelope on stderr with stdout empty** (the stdout=data /
stderr=diagnostics hygiene) carrying a **stable kebab error kind** with the
process exit code mirroring `error.code`. Every surface also asserts **no
ANSI/TUI escape on stdout** and **bounded completion**.

Interpreting outcomes:

| Outcome | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| **PASS** | process exited (not signal-killed) within the bound, stdout was pure JSON, identity/error-kind assertions held. |
| **FAIL (assertion)** | a surface dispatched wrong, leaked stdout, drifted an error kind, or mis-mirrored its exit code — the panic names the surface, argv, and payload head; every surface is evaluated and logged **before** the panic, so the proof log shows the full picture without a rerun. |
| **TIMEOUT (≠ pass, ≠ fail)** | a surface exceeded the per-surface bound (a hang, e.g. an accidental bare-TUI launch blocking on closed stdin) — the `TIMEOUT DIAGNOSTIC` block on stderr (phase, pid, elapsed, data-dir listing, stdout/stderr tails) is the timeout-vs-pass discriminator. |

Surface signatures are pinned against the golden robot JSON under
`tests/golden/robot/`; an intentional contract change updates both together.

## 8. Lightweight proof artifacts (`.11.4`)

Bead `…uojcg.11.4`. Where §4's `.12.3` `ProofLogRecord` is the heavyweight
record emitted by the bounded runner, `src/proof_artifact.rs` is the **lightweight
classifier** that any test, gauntlet, or smoke gate can emit without standing up
the full runner. It exists so the five-plus confusable outcomes — `pass`,
`fail`, `timeout`, `skipped`, `stale-artifact`, `generated-only`,
`partial-proof` — are recorded distinctly, with the safety-first precedence that
**a timeout outranks a zero exit** (the 7200s-timeout-before-tests trap can never
read as a pass) and **assertions that did not run are `generated-only`, never a
pass**.

Emitting an artifact:

```rust
use coding_agent_search::proof_artifact::{ProofRun, emit_proof_artifact, ProofManifest};

// Record the run's facts (timestamps in; no clock read inside), classify, and
// write `<dir>/<label>.proof.json`:
let emitted = emit_proof_artifact(proof_dir, "repro-capsule-search-miss", run)?;

// Aggregate into a manifest whose verdict cannot pass by doing nothing:
let mut manifest = ProofManifest::new();
manifest.record(emitted);
assert!(manifest.is_clean_pass());          // false when empty or any non-pass entry
manifest.write_jsonl(&proof_dir.join("proof-manifest.jsonl"))?;
```

`ProofManifest::is_clean_pass()` is the log-completeness verdict for this layer:
it is `true` only when there is **at least one** entry and **every** entry is a
trustworthy `pass`. An empty manifest (a gate that ran nothing) and any single
`timeout` / `stale-artifact` / `generated-only` / `fail` / `partial-proof` /
`skipped` entry both return `false`. `worst_status()` surfaces the single most
severe outcome for a one-line rollup.

Wiring into a gate (reference adopter):

```sh
# Each scenario emits one `<label>.proof.json` into $CASS_PROOF_DIR:
CASS_PROOF_DIR=<dir> rch exec -- env CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/tmp/cass-check-target \
  cargo test --test e2e_repro_capsule_gate
```

`tests/e2e_repro_capsule_gate.rs` is the reference adopter: its `run_capsule`
emits a proof artifact per invocation when `CASS_PROOF_DIR` is set, and
`proof_artifacts_emit_and_distinguish_pass_from_timeout` proves end-to-end that a
real passing run emits a `pass` artifact while a timeout-before-assertions emits
`timeout` (and sinks the manifest). A closure citing this layer points at the
`$CASS_PROOF_DIR` artifact files + the exact `cargo test` command above — not
prose. The lib classifier itself is proven by
`cargo test --lib proof_artifact` (`test result: ok`).
